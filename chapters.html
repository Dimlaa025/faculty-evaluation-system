    <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Background</h3>
    <p>Evaluating the performance of faculty members is essential for maintaining the quality of education in any academic institution. However, many universities still rely on traditional, paper-based evaluation systems that are often slow, inefficient, and prone to errors. These manual processes can lead to delayed feedback, lost data, and missed opportunities for faculty improvement.</p>
    <p>At Wesleyan University-Philippines, the BSIT program under the College of Engineering and Computer Technology (CECT) recognizes the need for a better system. This project aims to create an Online Faculty Performance Evaluation System with integrated Data Analytics.</p>
    <p>Data analytics plays an increasingly important role in modern education systems. Beyond simply collecting scores, it allows institutions to uncover patterns, measure trends, and make evidence-based decisions. Administrators can identify areas where faculty members excel and detect early signs of challenges. This supports targeted professional development and improved teaching strategies.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Statement of the Problem</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>What challenges and inefficiencies are present in the current manual evaluation process?</li>
      <li>How can an online platform make faculty evaluations quicker, more reliable, and more meaningful?</li>
      <li>In what ways can data analytics enhance the interpretation of evaluation results for better decision-making?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1.3 Objectives</h3>
    <p><strong>General Objective:</strong> To design and develop an online faculty performance evaluation system with data analytics for the BSIT program at CECT.</p>
    <p><strong>Specific Objectives:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify issues and limitations in the current evaluation process.</li>
      <li>Create a web-based platform where students can submit evaluations easily.</li>
      <li>Integrate data analytics tools that provide clear summaries and insights from the evaluation results.</li>
      <li>Assess the system's usability, reliability, and overall effectiveness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4 Scope</h3>
    <p>This project focuses on the online creation and submission of faculty evaluation forms, real-time aggregation and basic analysis of evaluation data, and visualization of results through dashboards and summary reports. The system will be implemented specifically for the BSIT program during AY 2024-2025.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Significance of the Study</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Students:</strong> Easier, faster, and anonymous feedback submissions.</li>
      <li><strong>Faculty Members:</strong> Timely and detailed evaluations to guide improvement.</li>
      <li><strong>Administrators:</strong> Access to data-driven reports to support decisions about faculty development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chapter 2: Method</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Research Design</h3>
    <p>This study used a developmental-descriptive research design. The developmental part focused on building the system, while the descriptive part evaluated its effectiveness and usability.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Participants</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>50 BSIT students who completed faculty evaluations.</li>
      <li>5 faculty members who were evaluated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 System Development Approach</h3>
    <p>The Agile development method was used, which included planning, designing, coding, testing, and refinement phases. The system used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend</li>
      <li>PHP and MySQL for backend and database</li>
      <li>Chart.js for data visualization</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.4 Data Collection Procedures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Interviews with administrators and students</li>
      <li>Surveys measuring system satisfaction</li>
      <li>System logs tracking usage and performance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.5 Data Analysis</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> Survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics.</li>
      <li><strong>System Metrics:</strong> Error rates, load times, and submission rates were monitored.</li>
      <li><strong>Qualitative:</strong> Open-ended feedback was reviewed for insights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.6 Ethical Considerations</h3>
    <p>All participants gave informed consent. Confidentiality was maintained and no personally identifiable data was shared in reports.</p>
